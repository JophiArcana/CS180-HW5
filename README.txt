CS180-HW1.ipynb is the only code necessary for things to run. Upload the 
file to Google Drive and run using Colab. To make the submission 
under the size requirement, .tif files are removed so the code will 
not work unless you upload the source images. Links to download 
the used images from the Prokudin-Gorskii Collection are given below:
